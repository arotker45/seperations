This repository contains a number of functions that will aid in the design and calculation of several seperations processes. These include:

-batch distillation, batch()
-stripping and absorption, stripp() and absorb()
-LLE distillation of ternary systems, LLE()
-distillation columns, with two or more different types of feeds, distillation_column()

These functions will be fairly robust, capable of calculating several different parameters based on the values being input.
All of them are intended to be used in the terminal.
